<p>"GENTLEMEN Arbitrators, I salute you in the concrete," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, walking up to the table of the Hall of
Congress at Geneva. "I also salute you specially. <span class="smcap">Count Sclopis</span>, <i>una voce poco fà</i>; <span class="smcap">M. Staempfli</span>, my Merry
Swiss Boy, <i>point d'argent, point de Suisse</i>; <span class="smcap">Baron Itajuba</span>, I hope your <i>sangre azul</i> is cool this hot weather."</p>

<p>"Really, <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>," said the <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice Cockburn</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And really, my dear <span class="smcap">Sir Alexander</span>," was <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>'s lightning-like repartee. "How are you? and <span class="smcap">Davis</span>, my
<span class="smcap">Bancroft</span>, how are you? Have you seen <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bancroft</span> in <i>Caste</i>? Capital, isn't she? And now to business, and after
that we'll go for a row on the Lake, my Allobroges. Know they settled here, <span class="smcap">Davis</span>?"</p>

<p>"I know several things," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Davis</span>, "and one is that you have no business in this chamber."</p>

<p>"<i>Rem acu tetigisti</i>, my Occidental. My visit is strictly on pleasure. And I reckon to have the pleasure of sticking
these here Negotiations in a greased groove before I quit."</p>

<p>"Porter!" exclaimed the <span class="smcap">Count Sclopis</span>, angrily.</p>

<p>"Not a drop, I thank you," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, smiling. "We should not get it good here. A bottle of Seltzer, if you
please, with a slight dash of the liquid named after yonder lake, but unsweetened."</p>

<p>His exquisite good-temper&mdash;he associates with <span class="smcap">Granville</span> and <span class="smcap">Disraeli</span>&mdash;was too much for the dignitaries. They
all shook hands with him, said he was welcome, and begged that he would go away until dinner-time.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, my Beamish Boys," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>. "I am going to earn that dinner."</p>

<p>"But, dear <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>," pleaded <span class="smcap">Mr. Davis</span>, "we can't admit another British Representative, especially so omnipotent
a one as yourself."</p>

<p>"You are polite, and I'm cosmopolite, my dear <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. <i>Non ubi nascor, sed ubi pascor</i>, and being asked to an
international repast I shall behave internationally."</p>

<p>"You will have to let him speak," laughed <span class="smcap">Baron Itajuba</span>.</p>

<p>"You open your mouth to drop Brazilian diamonds, my Baron."</p>

<p>"<i>He'd better remain, for I don't think he'll go</i>," gaily carolled the Chief Justice, with a reminiscence of a burlesque
written at a time when burlesques were comic.</p>

<p>"<i>Take your brief, and belabour away</i>," sang the Merry Swiss Boy.</p>

<p>"Come, <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>," said the Count, "you and I have a common Italian ancestry. Do us credit."</p>

<p>"<i>Con rispetto parlando</i>, Count, you ought not to doubt that I shall. Arbitrators! Have you all read <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>?"</p>

<p>"There's a question!" shouted Everybody, indignantly. "Have five great nations sent clowns to represent them?"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span>
"I will soon see about that," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>. "When the good <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span> was asked to decide a most
tangled, knotty, and vast law-suit, over which a hundred lawyers had wrangled and fattened for years, what was his first
order? Nay, answer me not in words, but let me take my cooling draught, and see whether you know <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>."</p>

<p>As with one impulse all sprang up, delight in each face. Secretaries and porters were summoned, and every
scrap of paper, from the smallest Note to the most gigantic Case was removed into the court-yard. In five minutes all the
painted glass in the windows was richly illuminated, and the flames roared like Vesuvius.</p>

<p>"In these circumstances," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, "and as thinking of the 'frozen Caucasus' will not enable one to bear
roasting, M. the Count, you might order me some ice."</p>

<p>"Icebergs to <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> till further notice," said the magnificent Italian, in a style worthy of <span class="smcap">Cosmo</span> himself.</p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> studied <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>," said <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, when the fire had subsided, "and I am sure that you will continue
to be guided by his wisdom. Do you accept my sentence, in this Anglo-American business, as final. No 'understandings,'
mind. Swear it, with good mouth-filling oaths."</p>

<p>They all sent out fervent voices, but <span class="smcap">Mr. Davis</span> (who has had the advantage of knowing <span class="smcap">Mr. Greeley</span>) discharged
a kuss so terrific that it tore all the other sounds to tatters.</p>

<p>"Hear, and record the oath, immoral Gods!" exclaimed <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, in a manner like that of <span class="smcap">John Kemble</span>, only
superior in impressiveness. "And now I shall give you a judgment like that of the good <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span>. Stenographers!"</p>

<p>Then said <span class="smcap">Pantagruel-Punch</span>, "and the pauses amid his speech were more awful than the sound:"</p>

<p>"<span class="cursive">Not</span> having read one word of the cackle just combusted, and knowing and caring nothing about the matter in
question, I hereby give sentence that England shall pay to America, on the first of April last, nineteen thousand bottles
of hay with a needle in each. Shall, on the very first Sunday in the middle of the week, further pay to America eleven
millions of pigs in pokes; and finally, and without fail, Shall, in the next Greek Kalends, remit to Washington two
billions of bottles of smoke, and one thousand casks of the best pickled Australian moonshine, deodorised and aërated.</p>

<p>"<span class="cursive">But</span> seeing that America, in her turn, has reparation to make, I hereby give sentence that she shall send to
England, on the day of the election of the first Coloured President, twelve thousand barrels of the best pearl-oysters,
the pearls to be set with emeralds and rubies. Shall, on the day of celebration of the utter and entire extinction of
Bunkum, further pay to England eighty thousand barrels of Columbian Hail, and as many Birds o' Freedom, potted with
truffles; and lastly, Shall, on the recognition of the Independence of Mormonism, remit to London a hundred boxes of the
letters of which the United States have robbed the Queen's English; a thousand of the ropes which ought to have been
used in accelerating the quietude of Fenianism, and finally, and without fail, shall pay 30 per cent. on the profits of
'annexed' English literature.</p>

<p>"<span class="cursive">And</span> this I give for final judgment and decree indissoluble."</p>

<p>Everybody remained wrapt, in speechless admiration at the ineffable wisdom of <span class="smcap">Pantagruel-Punch</span>, who had
thus <span class="smcap">settled the American Question</span>. But what a shout went up to the Empyrean when he gently added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To enable you to interpret this sentence aright, I present you with my</p>

<h2>OUR QUEEN TO HER PEOPLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> open our New Volume with a record that will become historical.
No more acceptable Christmas gift could have been bestowed
upon a loyal and affectionate people than that which <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span>
has been pleased to present. It is the simple, warm, graceful
expression of a Mother's "deep sense of the touching sympathy of the
whole Nation on the occasion of the alarming illness of her dear son,
the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>." Thus writes our Sovereign, dating, happily,
from Windsor Castle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The universal feeling shown by her people during those painful, terrible
days, and the sympathy evinced by them with herself and her beloved
daughter, the <span class="smcap">Princess of Wales</span>, as well as the general joy at the
improvement in the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales's</span> state, have made a deep and
lasting impression on her heart which can never be effaced. It was, indeed,
nothing new to her, for the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> had met with the same sympathy when
just ten years ago a similar illness removed from her side the mainstay of her
life, the best, wisest, and kindest of husbands.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Queen</span> wishes to express at the same time, on the part of the
<span class="smcap">Princess of Wales</span>, her feelings of heartfelt gratitude, for she has been as
deeply touched as the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> by the great and universal manifestation of
loyalty and sympathy.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Queen</span> cannot conclude without expressing her hope that her
faithful subjects will continue their prayers to God for the complete recovery
of her dear son to health and strength."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"What can he do that cometh after the King?" is the language
of the Book. He who cometh after the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> will vainly seek to
write worthy comment on these words. But comment will be supplied
by all the hearts that are rejoicing in the happiness of a
Mother and of a Wife, and in the deliverance of a Nation from a
great sorrow.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2>The Festive Bored.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden time the boar's head was a common Christmas adjunct
to the board. The custom, it appears, has not entirely yet died out.
If one believes one's eyes and ears, one can hardly ever join a
family Christmas party, without finding at least one, if not more
than one, bore's head there.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h2>THE NATIONS' NEW-YEAR'S DAY.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="smcap">Beneath</span> the fading mistletoe in Time's wide-echoing Hall,&mdash;</p>
<p>The Yule-log's light still brisk and bright, on storied roof and wall&mdash;</p>
<p>The Spirits of the Nations, some strange, some kith and kin,</p>
<p>Are met to flout the Old Year out and <i>fête</i> the New Year in.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>With war-stains dim on robe and limb, fresh scars on cheek and brow,</p>
<p>France strives to look as though no pains could crush, no losses bow:</p>
<p>But her glance is quick and restless, and her hands are never still,</p>
<p>As one that, fevered inly, masks but masters not her ill.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>As if in mock of Christmas wreaths,&mdash;their "peace, good-will to men"&mdash;</p>
<p>What fierce hate in her eyes whene'er proud Prussia meets their ken!</p>
<p>Prussia that, stern and stately, her great sword, laurel-wreathed,</p>
<p>Bears wary, so, 'tis hard to know if bare the blade, or sheathed.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>So light and lithe that stalwart frame in movement or at rest,</p>
<p>You scarce would deem you caught the gleam of steel below her breast;</p>
<p>Beneath the wide imperial robe, that, fire-new, sweeps the ground,</p>
<p>With what now seems a diadem, and now a helmet, crowned.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But mark yon maid, of loveliness more radiant and more rare</p>
<p>Than all the showers of gems and flowers that star her night of hair;</p>
<p>For strength and grace to fit that face, what music but the tongue</p>
<p>Wherein stern <span class="smcap">Dante</span> chaunted, and silvery <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span> sung?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Queen among Queens! But never Queen full-robed and crowned till now,</p>
<p>The double diadem of Rome on her exultant brow!</p>
<p>Who notes the dust, who recks the rust, that dulls or dims its sheen,</p>
<p>Or asks how she came by it, or through what mire it has been?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>From sleep or strife new roused to life that lights her antique face,</p>
<p>No monkish train nor slavish chain to cramp her strength and grace,</p>
<p>What wonder if she hardly know in soberness to still</p>
<p>The throbbing of late-loosened blood, the stir of waking will?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Others are there, though notable, less notable than these:</p>
<p>See Russia, blue-eyed giantess, still rude and ill at ease:</p>
<p>But who can tell what undrawn wells of power and strength are there,</p>
<p>Under the brow that looms so broad below her fell of hair?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And Austria, motley madam, 'twixt Vienna <i>demi-monde</i>,</p>
<p>Tyrolian <i>mädchen</i>, Magyar <i>brune</i>, and rough Sclavonian <i>blonde</i>:</p>
<p>Of look more gracious than her mood, more potent than her power,</p>
<p>Trying all arts, and changing trick and toilet with the hour.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And Spain, still proud as when she walked New World and Old a Queen,</p>
<p>Beneath her soiled and frayed brocades the rags plain to be seen,</p>
<p>Stately of speech, but beggarly of all but sounding phrase,</p>
<p>Slattern at home and shrew abroad, in worse as better days.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>With sidelong and suspicious looks on Russia, Austria cast,</p>
<p>Which scarce her yashmak serves to hide, see Turkey gliding past.</p>
<p>A harem-beauty out of place 'twixt angers and alarms</p>
<p>At the hot looks of would-be Lords, that lust to own her charms.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Casting about for shelter she draws where, hand in hand,</p>
<p>Fair England and Columbia, proud child, proud mother, stand:</p>
<p>Time was upon each other they had turned less friendly eyes,</p>
<p>But of late both have grown wiser than let angry passions rise.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>To the side of stout <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> I see scared Turkey creep,</p>
<p>Though <span class="smcap">Britannia</span> lifts no finger her foes at bay to keep:</p>
<p>But, for all her quiet bearing, there is something in her air</p>
<p>That brings to mind the good old saw, "Of sleeping dogs beware!"</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Twelve struck&mdash;and I saw grey Old Time his wassail-bowl uprear,</p>
<p>As he called on all the Nations to drink in the New Year;</p>
<p>But first to drink the Old Year out, that to his end has come,</p>
<p>With small cause to regret him, as he passes on to doom.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And looking on those Nations, scarce a single face I saw</p>
<p>But over it lay such a cloud as doubt and fear might draw:</p>
<p>As if all wished the Old Year gone, while yet all doubted sore</p>
<p>If their welcome to the New Year should be hopefuller, therefor.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Some, thinking of disasters past, worse sorrows seemed to see,</p>
<p>In the near or farther future, up seething gloomily:</p>
<p>Some thinking of advantage won, seemed scarce to trust their hold</p>
<p>On that advantage, lest their prize turn dust, like fairy gold.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Only methought that Britain and Columbia, 'mid their peers,</p>
<p>Showed eyes more hopeful, calmer brows, and lips less pale with fears:</p>
<p>As having clearer view than most where surest faith should lie&mdash;</p>
<p>To put their trust in Providence, and keep their powder dry.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>As being bent to fight the fight of common sense and truth:</p>
<p>Nor yield the faith therein to fear, the rights thereof to ruth:</p>
<p>Not give knaves, fools, or fanatics, the driving seat and reins:</p>
<p>Worthy his hire to own each man who works, with hand or brains.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>To recognise the Heavenly rule that various lots assigns,</p>
<p>But ranges high and low alike 'neath Duty's even lines:</p>
<p>To do to others as we would that they to us should do,</p>
<p>To prize the blessings that we have, and others help thereto.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>While Britain to this faith is firm, and puts this faith in deed,</p>
<p>Little to her how plenteous or how poor the years succeed.</p>
<p>She holds a hope good fortune reared not up, ill casts not down;</p>
<p>Trusting the Power whose hand alike is o'er Red-Cap and Crown.</p>

<h2>OLD GHOSTS AND NEW.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> old, around the whitening embers,</p>
<p>One, here and there, as yet remembers</p>
<p>The tales of Ghosts, at Christmas season,</p>
<p>Which once were wont to stagger Reason.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Those tales are told no more at Christmas,</p>
<p>Whose Ghosts are laid beyond the Isthmus</p>
<p>Of Suez, all beneath the billows</p>
<p>Of the Red Sea, on sandy pillows.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The Ghosts with eyes of flame and saucer</p>
<p>Are now as obsolete as <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>;</p>
<p>No Ghosts now rattle chains, nor blue light</p>
<p>Emit, but "Spirit Lights"&mdash;a new light.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>White-sheeted Ghosts have grown mere fables.</p>
<p>Instead of groaning, Ghosts rap tables:</p>
<p>With smells of sulphur ne'er assail us;</p>
<p>With curious perfumes oft regale us.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>They "mediums" raise by "levitation,"</p>
<p>And subject them to elongation,</p>
<p>And in and out of windows float them,</p>
<p>Two stories high, lords vow, we quote them.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Fruit, flowers, ice, other forms of matter,</p>
<p>On tables, in the dark, Ghosts scatter;</p>
<p>Live lobsters, wriggling eels, and so forth:</p>
<p>Thus their "so potent art" they show forth.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">

<p><span class="smcap">A pretty</span> dodge that is of the doctors and sawbones which
have signed that there declaration respectin' Halcohol has as bin
publish'd in the Papers. Wot I refers to moor partickler is their
sayin that "Alcohol, in whatever form, should be prescribed with
as much care as any powerful drug." Take this here along with
their likewise sayin as they thinks the sale of liquors ought to be
restricted by "wise
legislation." Yah!
What's the legislation
as them medical
gentlemen would
call wise? I won't
say, I should like to
know, cos why I do
know, and which
therefore please alow
me for to state, for
to put a inliten'd
Brittish Public on
their gard agin a
Doo. A liquor law
for to shut up all the
publichouses, and
confine the sale of
liquors&mdash;Halcohol in
wotsomedever form,
mind yer&mdash;to the
'pothecaries, chemists,
and druggists,
to be sold hunder
conditions, like assnic
or strikenine, or
only wen horder'd
by a fisitian's perscription.
That's
their objeck. That's
wot they're arter.

with arf an i they're

get the ole of the

<p>Now, Sir, just
fancy under that
sistim, if so be ever
it passes, witch Evin
forbid, what a halteration
we should
see direckly in
doctors' shops. In
coarse they'd ave to
be a good deal inlarged
to make room
for the Bar and Beer-engine.
Then, my
i, what a variety of
rum labels there
would be on the big
bottles, and the reseavers,
and resevoys
witch praps would
do dooty amongst
the fizzic for caskes
and barrels. A
young doctor chap,
as uses my ouse, and
promises to be a horniment
to his perfession,
rote me down a
few names of liquors; he says, in Doctors' lattin, along with Pil: Colocynth
Comp:, and Mist: Camph:, and sitch as we shall then see&mdash;Cerevis:

Sp: Sacchari Jamaicens: Opt:; Vetus Thomas:; Ros Montan:;
&amp;c.; all witch you and your honour'd readers, bein scollards, will
hunderstand. Yes; and you'll have medickle men perscribin wine,
beer, and sperrits in quantities of Oj., and &#8485;j. or &#8485;ij., and &#658;ifs.,
and &#9807;iij.; and patients will be payin extry fees to ave the same
perscribed for 'em&mdash;dram drinkin in drams order'd medisinally.</p>

<p>Wich, afore that state of things is brought to pass, with defence
not defiance for our motter, wot I say is, let's nale our cullers to the
mast, No Surrender, and take to supplyin our customers with the
werry best rubub, senna, and prerogative drugs, and likewise
pilicotia, bark, prussic hacid and pizon of hevery description, as well
as Halcohol in watever form, wich they pertends is so pernishus.</p>

<p>The Doctors' liquor shops, I dare say, will shut up on Sundays&mdash;but
then no doubt but wot a short Notis outside will hinform you
that "Medicine may be obtained by ringing the bell," the medsin
including anything on draught you may choose to name, not exceptin
punch, which
cures the gout, the

allowed to be the
werry best of fizzic.

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a fine
specimen of Army
Reform. We cite it
from that Military
authority, the <i>Civilian</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The expense of
providing and maintaining
window blinds
for officers' quarters is
not chargeable against
the public. Blinds now
fixed, which have been
supplied free of charge,
may remain, provided
they be maintained at
the occupants' expense.
Any occupant not wishing
to retain the blinds
at his own cost, will
make a notification to
this effect to the Controller
of the district,
in order that they may
be removed and taken
into store."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Officers' better
halves are hardly
likely to approve of
this retrenchment in
officers' quarters.
Faded furniture and
carpets will probably
not find much favour
in their eyes,
nor will those eyes
shine any brighter
for being dazzled, as
they will be, when
the sunbeams
stream in blindingly
through the blindless
windows. In
rooms that face due
South, a parasol will
be a useful adjunct
to a breakfast table,
and we may even
hear of officers with
weak eyes being attacked
by sharp
ophthalmia, and, all owing to their blindless quarters, becoming
helpless inmates of the Blind Asylum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">is</span> a gratification to <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, to be able to announce
that he has entered
into an arrangement with
descendants of the celebrated
<i>Masters Sandford
and Merton</i>, who, with
their admirable preceptor,
the grandson of the illustrious
<i>Mr. Barlow</i>, will,
during the present Christmas
Holidays, visit most
of the Metropolitan amusements.</p>

<p>One morning, as they
were sitting, after breakfast,
in their lodgings in
the Strand, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> said to
<span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, "May I ask
you a question, Sir?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> considered
for a few moments, and
then granted the desired
permission.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> What, Sir, is a
Pantomime?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow</i> (<i>smiling</i>).
Perhaps <span class="smcap">Harry</span> can tell
you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Willingly, <span class="smcap">Master
Tommy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> I should like
very much to hear.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You must know,
then, <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span>, that in London there are a great many
buildings called Theatres, or The<i>ay</i>ters, to which some people go,
and, in cases where the free list is entirely suspended, and the
absurd system of orders is abolished, actually pay money in the
expectation of being amused by the performers. Indeed, at Christmas-time,
when nearly every sort of entertainment is open to the
public, it is a person's own fault if he is not constantly amused.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> But pray, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, have you no more particulars to tell
me about these Pantomimes?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You can judge for yourself, <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was so affected with this rebuke, that he only restrained
his tears by a strong physical exertion, which resulted in his giving
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> a kick on the shins underneath the table. For this, being
a boy of generous disposition, he had the good-breeding and courtesy
to apologise, in time to avert the severe damage which his head
would have received at the hands of his friend <span class="smcap">Harry</span>; and, in order
to propitiate the justly-aroused anger of <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow, Master
Tommy</span> offered to treat <span class="smcap">Harry Sandford</span> and their worthy preceptor
to the play that very night; a proposal which, after some
show of reluctance, both <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry Sandford</span> cordially
accepted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At <span class="smcap">Drury Lane</span>.&mdash;On their arrival in the lobby of the Dress
Circle, a kindly-spoken gentleman insisted upon relieving the party
of their coats, and gave them a programme of the performance, for
which they returned him their most sincere thanks; <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>,
moreover, promised him a gratuity on his leaving the theatre. This
promise was accompanied by a significant look at <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, who fully
appreciated his worthy preceptor's conduct. As to <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, he was
too full of wonder and admiration of all he saw to notice this transaction,
and, indeed, the questions which arose to his lips during the
evening were so numerous, that, with a discretion beyond his years,
he determined to reserve them for a future occasion.</p>

<p>The Pantomime was <i>Tom Thumb</i>.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> The <span class="smcap">Vokes's</span> are very comical people with their legs.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Yes, truly; and, being so, it is a thousand pities
any of them should attempt to sing. Their dancing is highly amusing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was here very much alarmed by the appearance of a
Giant's head over the castle wall. His fears were not allayed when
the Giant ate <i>Tom Thumb</i>, who, on his re-appearance from the
Giant's mouth, was taken up in the claws of a huge bird. This
made <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> cry; and it was not until <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> had explained
to him that the object of the Pantomime was to make little boys and
girls laugh, that he at all recovered his wonted spirits. However,
on seeing that <span class="smcap">Harry</span> was smiling, and that <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> was
composing himself to sleep, he was reassured by their demeanour,
and became deeply interested in the stage representation.</p>

<p>At the Scene of Dresden China Watteauesque figures, <span class="smcap">Tommy's</span>
delight declared itself in loud applause.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> Are <i>those</i> the Clowns? I thought you said, Sir, that
there was only <i>one</i> Clown!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> To the eye of the rightly constituted mind there can
be but one Clown; and our mental vision is only disturbed and confused
by this multiplication of drolls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> further explained that the Clown is human like
ourselves; whereat <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> expressed himself dissatisfied.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> As the comic scenes appear to depress you, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>,
and as <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> is evidently becoming tired and cross withal, it were
best to leave.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Indeed, Sir, this Pantomime reminds me of what you told
me about the shape of the earth.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> I do not see, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, how you connect the two
subjects. There is a vast difference between this planet and a
Pantomime.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Indeed, Sir, there is; for our planet is entirely round,
and this Pantomime is remarkably flat.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Beware of such wholesale condemnations, my dear
<span class="smcap">Harry</span>; this Pantomime has already given delight to some twenty
thousand persons, every one, it may be, as good as yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was much pleased, however, at <span class="smcap">Harry's</span> application of a
scientific fact, and expressed his determination of learning Astronomy
at once, in order that he might be as ready as <span class="smcap">Harry</span> on
any suitable occasion.</p>

<p>On quitting the theatre, <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> promised the box-keeper a
sixpence, whereat the poor man could scarcely refrain from embracing
his benefactor. So they left.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Next Night&mdash;covent Garden.</span>&mdash;Here they saw the Pantomime
of <i>Blue Beard</i>. As each new Scene presented itself to their view,
they were vehemently enraptured, and thought that no expression
of praise could suffice to express their pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Certainly the scenery is very beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> The ladies are indeed lovely!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> They are mortal.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> O, here is <i>Blue Beard's</i> procession! I know the story!
And here are the Camels, and&mdash;O!&mdash;a White Elephant!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> The Camel, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, is found chiefly in
burning climates. In his temper he is gentle and tractable, and his
patience in being&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Audience.</i> Hush! Order! Turn him out!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Indeed, Sir, they are alluding to you! Would it not be
better to remain silent, and watch a Scene which gives everyone so
much gratification?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> perceived the sense of this remark, and confined
himself to explaining to <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, in an undertone, that <span class="smcap">Mr. Macdermott</span>,
who played <i>Blue Beard</i>, had been, till lately, an actor at
the Grecian Theatre, where he was considered "funny;" but that
here his humour seemed to be limited to an imitation of one <span class="smcap">Mr.
Clarke</span>, an actor of burlesque parts most favourably known to
playgoers; and, indeed, the audience seemed to be largely of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Barlow's</span> mind, for it was not until <i>Mr. Blue Beard</i> danced,
which he did cleverly, that they testified their approbation of his
drolleries.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> This Scene of the Amazons' Encampment will attract
the whole town. It is indeed a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> There must be thousands on the stage!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> smiled at this, and was about to demonstrate, mathematically,
the improbability of more than three hundred of the <i>corps
de ballet</i> being on the scene at once, when his attention was attracted
to the Grand Transformation Scene by vociferous applause, in which
he was conscientiously able to join. On their quitting the theatre,
at eleven o'clock, the boys were loud in their praises of what they
had seen.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> How diverting were those French dancers! and the
Shadows!</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> And the Clown with the two boys! and their fiddles and
musical bells!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> You are right. With the comic scenes and the
Clown came the fun peculiar to this species of amusement, of which
there was, amid all the glitter and splendour, a lack. And perhaps
this is as it should be; for why term the Harlequinade "the Comic
Scenes," unless they are so by comparison with the previous portion
of the Pantomime?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Your observation, Sir, reminds me of the entertaining story
of <i>Sophronius</i> and <i>Kydaspes</i>, which <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> has not yet heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> was about to commence the tale without further parley,
when it was discovered that <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> had slipped out of the room,
and had, it was supposed, retired to bed. <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> therefore
intimated that, as <i>he</i> had heard the story before, it would be better
if they both followed their young friend's example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> submitted to this arrangement; and when the two boys were
assured that their worthy preceptor was asleep, they took his latchkey,
and sallied forth to enjoy themselves at <span class="smcap">Evans's</span> supper-rooms.</p>

A VIRTUOUS VESTRY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;">
<a href="images/005.png"><img width="100%" src="images/005.png" alt="B" /></a>
</div>

<p>E it known that a sort of
Fair or miscellaneous Market
is held in the New Cut
(excuse mention of such a
place) every Sunday morning.
There do people of
the baser sort buy their
Sunday dinners, and other
matters which they fancy
they want. The Lambeth
Vestry, justly indignant
at such goings on, appealed
to <span class="smcap">Colonel Henderson</span>
to put a stop to
them. That haughty and
sarcastic official declared
that he should do nothing
of the sort, unless the
shopkeepers who keep
their shops open on Sundays
were also obliged to
respect the day of rest.
We pity the Colonel's want
of logical power. What is
there in common between
a respectable shopkeeper, who pays rates, and a low person who
wheels a barrow, or rents the flap over a cellarage? The Vestry
scorned such terms, and have been taking the names of the vendors
at this fair, and such addresses as the miserable creatures could
give. Summonses have been issued, but the matter stands over
for a few weeks.</p>

<p>At the end of that time, <i>Mr. Punch</i> cordially trusts that the
Lambeth Vestry will sternly carry out their plan for promoting the
respectability of the New Cut, and if <span class="smcap">Colonel Henderson</span> again
refuses to help them, let appeal be made to <span class="smcap">Mr. Bruce</span>. There is
not the least pretence for holding the Fair. Let the people in and
about the New Cut buy their fish, meat, and the rest of their luxuries
on Saturday. What is to prevent them from doing so. Wages
are always paid at an early hour on Saturday, and by four o'clock
on that day the wife of an artisan has always received from her
husband the bulk of his earnings, less perhaps by a trifle which she
playfully returns to him, that he may have a pipe and a pint before
going to bed. He would be considered a bad fellow if he did not
give her the money, or if she had to coax it out of him late, or to
take it from his pocket when he had sunk into the gentle slumber of
intoxication. That he should surlily refuse it, and strike her, and
force her to wait until morning brought better temper, is too monstrous
an idea. "Our flesh and blood" never does this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Let the Wife therefore make her purchases on Saturday. Let her
take her fish and meat home. We are perfectly aware that they are
perishable articles, but we suppose that they can be put into the
pantry down-stairs, or that, if domestics or cats are distrusted, the
food can be placed in the refrigerator. That article is cheap enough,
anyhow, and a very good one can be got for three or four guineas,
and it is the affectation of ignorance to say that ice is not at hand,
for we know that the Wenham Lake carts go round several times a
week&mdash;this we state from our own knowledge, and we hate sentimentality.
By this means not only will offence to the refined
natures of the Lambeth Vestry be avoided, but the vendors of the
articles will be released from work, and enabled to attend places of
worship. To their own declaration that but for Sunday trade they
must go to the workhouse, we lend a deaf ear. Morality cannot
yield to Necessity. A prudent man will earn his income in six days.
If he cannot, we must echo the remark made by a conscientious
person at a meeting on the subject, and say, "Let him starve."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> strongly upholds the Lambeth Vestry in this business,
and thinks their conduct quite worthy of the reputation they have
so long borne. He is much displeased with the Colonel of Police,
and hopes never to have to say, in <span class="smcap">Mr. Pope's</span> words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Stern <span class="smcap">Henderson</span> repented,</p>
<p>And gave them back the Fair."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>If Vestries will enforce Sabbatarianism, and if Alliances will
totally deprive the weaker classes of the Refreshments of which
they mostly make bad use, we shall raise the standard of national
morals, and entirely efface the discontent which some persons believe
is felt with national institutions.</p>

<h2>HOROSCOPE FOR 1872.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the aid of this ingenious little instrument, the horoscope,
which is simple in construction, easily cleaned, and to be had of all
respectable dealers throughout the kingdom in gold, silver, mother-of-pearl,
ormolu, aluminium, and other suitable materials, a clear
insight may be obtained, on a fine evening, into the more salient
events of the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.</p>

<p>The observations we have been enabled to make with one of these
instruments (fitted with the patent self-acting forecaster) are so
startling that, without loss of time, we hasten to lay them before
the world, for the guidance and direction of reigning Sovereigns,
Cabinet Ministers, School-Boards, Members of Parliament, Mayors,
Magistrates, Mothers of Marriageable Daughters, Managers of
Theatres, Newspaper Editors, Speculators, and others, who may be
desirous to make their arrangements at once for the ensuing twelve
months.</p>

<p>Parliament will meet early in February, a few days after it ceases
to be legal to slaughter pheasants. It will be prorogued early in
August, about the period when grouse-shooting becomes a lawful
pastime.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> will withdraw several measures in the
course of the Session.</p>

<p>The London School-Board, by the active interposition of its
Beadles, will clear the streets of from ten to twenty children.</p>

<p>Australian meat will appear on the bill of fare at the Lord
Mayor's banquets.</p>

<p>In the month of February a most serious astronomical occurrence
will take place, one which ought to make a great noise in the world,
and is likely to be attended with disastrous consequences to those who
may be unfortunate enough to be on the spot&mdash;<i>the full moon will
fall</i> on Saturday, the 24th.</p>

<p>There will be at least one new cookery-book published during the
year.</p>

<p>Good port wine will become scarcer and dearer than ever.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> will, in his annual Budget,
propose a tax upon one or more of the following articles:&mdash;calling
cards, dolls, pins, perambulators, umbrellas, and wigs.</p>

<p>The Mines Regulation Bill will be brought before Parliament;
also the <span class="smcap">Collier</span> affair.</p>

<p>There will be a show (the first) of guinea-pigs, white mice, parrots,
bullfinches, and squirrels at the Crystal Palace. The <span class="smcap">Duchess
Of Launceston</span>, <span class="smcap">Lady Ida Down</span>, and the Honourable <span class="smcap">Mrs. Alfred
Warblemore</span> will act as Judges.</p>

<p>Several new animals will be added to the collection in the Zoological
Gardens.</p>

<p>The jury in the Tichborne case will retire when the trial is concluded,
and, after deliberating for several days, will return into
Court late at night, and deliver their Verdict amidst breathless
silence. The <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron</span> will have a sleeping apartment
fitted up in the Westminster Sessions House, that no time may be
lost in calling him up to receive the verdict.</p>

<p>Several Colonial Bishops will return home.</p>

<p>An eye should be kept on the Pope, the Orleans Princes, the Irish
Roman Catholic Bishops, the Publicans, the Republicans, the
Spiritualists, the Ritualists, <span class="smcap">Sir Charles Dilke</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Whalley</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Butt</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Brock</span>, the pyrotechnist, as they may all be
expected to do extraordinary things.</p>

<p>An eminent Archdeacon of the Established Church, well known
in the West of England, will conduct the services at <span class="smcap">Mr. Spurgeon's</span>
Tabernacle, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Spurgeon</span> will exchange pulpits with him.</p>

<p>A new Opera will be brought out on the last night but two of

<h2>MARK LEMON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> became our duty, some weeks ago, to invite the attention of our
readers to the fact that a Memorial Fund, in aid of the Widow and
unmarried Daughters of our late lamented friend, <span class="smcap">Mark Lemon</span>, had
been opened. On a page at the end of our present issue will be
found the list of those who have subscribed to the Fund. Several
donors have been generous, many have been very liberal, and thanks
are due to those who have "done what they could." But the aggregate
amount as yet obtained is altogether inadequate to the purpose,
that of making a permanent provision for those so dear to one
who never lost an opportunity of doing a kindness. It is with
reluctance that, after examining the list, we admit to ourselves
that very much is owed to private friendship, and comparatively
little to public recognition of the noble character and the merits of
<span class="smcap">Mark Lemon</span>. Believing, as we sincerely believe, that we may
account for this by supposing that thousands are still unacquainted
with the fact that their aid is invited, we re-iterate our Appeal.
We venture also to ask our contemporaries, who have already so
ably and kindly promoted the object, again to perform that labour
of love. We, lastly, call attention to the notice at the foot of the
list, stating how subscriptions can be forwarded. Some misapprehension
on this point may have retarded the liberality which
we refuse to believe will not be shown to those who possess such
inherited and such personal claim to the kindly consideration of all.</p>

<h2>THE RETICENCE OF THE PRESS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The American Press</span> admires the reticence which the British
Press has practised during the seventy odd days occupied in hearing
one side of a cause which will be celebrated. The English Press
also takes credit to itself for that reticence. It is, doubtless, exemplary.
By not interfering with, we know how much it furthers,
the administration of Justice. A trial such as the great lawsuit now
pending, or any other in a British Court of Law, is determined,
we all know, simply by the weight of evidence, in relation to which
the minds of the jury are mere scales. The Counsel on either side
respectively confine themselves to the production of true evidence
each on behalf of his client, and the refutation of false evidence
advanced for the opposite party. The Judge is the only person in
Court who expresses any opinion on the case which could possibly
influence the jury; his opinion being expressed under the obligation
of strict impartiality. No barrister, whether counsel for the plaintiff
or the defendant, ever attempts to bias their decision either by
sophistry or appeals to their passions and prejudices. It is therefore
highly necessary that the Press should abstain as strictly as it
does from any explanation or argument with reference to a pending
suit which, how sincerely soever meant to instruct, might possibly
have the effect of misleading the jury sitting thereon.</p>

<p>If, indeed, Counsel were usually accustomed to employ the arts of
oratory, and the dodges of dialectics, in order to make the worst
appear the better cause in the eyes of twelve men more or less liable
to be deceived and deluded, then, indeed, the reticence of a respectable
and intelligent Press, in abstaining from any remarks capable
of helping a jury to deliver a righteous verdict, would not perhaps
be quite so purely advantageous as it is now.</p>

<p>ALK over all these
arrangements at
dinner. Then, as
we have, <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
tells me, to be up
early for otter-hunting,
we determine
upon going
to bed early.</p>

<p><i>Process of Going
to Bed Early.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs.
Pendell</span> retires
at nine, having
seen that "everything
we want" is
left out on the
sideboard. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
observes that
he shan't be half
an hour at most
before he's upstairs.
I yawn, to
show how tired I
am, and corroborate
his statement as to
the time we intend
to pass in front of
the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pendell</span>
has retired. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> wishes to know what I'll take. Nothing,
I thank him. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> doesn't "think&mdash;um&mdash;that&mdash;he'll&mdash;um&mdash;take
anything," and stands before a row of bottles with the critical
air of a Commander-in-Chief reviewing the line. It almost looks
as if he wanted a bottle to step out of the rank and invite him to
make up his mind at once and take a drop of <i>him</i>. In order
not to prevent him from enjoying himself, I sacrifice myself, and
say, "Well, I'll have just the smallest glass of whiskey." <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
is of opinion that no one can do better than whiskey, it being, he
says, the most wholesome spirit.</p>

<p>We whiskey. The quarter-past arrives. We take no notice of it,
except that <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> remarks that <i>that</i> clock is about twelve
minutes fast, in which case, of course, we have nearly half an hour
at our disposal. Conversation commences. We somehow get
upon Literature, especially upon the subject of my <i>Analytical
History of Motion</i>. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> quotes a line from somewhere. We
can't think where it is to be found.</p>

<p>This leads <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> to the book-shelves. While he is up, would
he mind just mixing me the least drop more whiskey&mdash;<i>and water</i>,
plenty of water. He does so, and continues his search for the book,
ending by bringing down the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>. "Do I remember
this one?" he asks me. No, I have forgotten it. He thinks the
line he quoted is there. He is, he says, going to give it at a Penny
Reading, and has already done so with great success. He reads a
few lines.</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;Ask him to read. Nothing so pleasant as the sound of
some one reading poetry when you're very tired, and are sitting
before a good fire. Light a pipe as an aid to listening comfortably.
Better than going to bed. Besides, if he reads, it's <i>his</i> fault that
we don't go to bed early, as we told <span class="smcap">Mrs. Pendell</span> we would.</p>

<p>He reads aloud. I interrupt him occasionally (opening my eyes
to do so), just to show I am attending, and twice I dispute the propriety
of his emphasis; but I don't sustain my side of the argument,
from a feeling that to close my eyes and be droned to sleep, is preferable
to straining every nerve in order to talk and keep awake.</p>

<p><i>11 o'clock</i>, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pendell</span> stops, and says, "Why, you're asleep!"
I reply that he is mistaken (having, in fact, just been awoke by
feeling as if a spring had given way at the nape of my neck), but I
own, candidly, to feeling a little tired.</p>

<p>"Um!" says <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, and puts his selection for a Penny Reading
away. Bed.</p>

<p><i>Morning.</i>&mdash;Am aroused by <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, who is always fresh. "Lovely
morning," he says, opening the curtains. [<i>Note.</i>&mdash;When you're
only one quarter awake there's something peculiarly obtrusive in
any remark about the beauty of the day. To a person comfortably
in bed and wishing to remain there, the state of the weather is
comparatively uninteresting, unless it's dismally foggy or thoroughly
rainy, when, in either case, you can congratulate yourself upon your
cleverness and forethought in not having got up.] "Is it?" I ask.
Through the window I see only mist and drizzle.</p>

<p>"Just the morning for otter-hunting!" exclaims <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, enthusiastically.
Then, as he's leaving the room, he turns, and says,
"O, by the way, I've just remembered that Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock's</span> pretty
sure to be out with the hounds. He's great fun out hunting."</p>

<p>This stirs me into something like exertion. Otters and <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>.
<span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>, during a check, setting the field in a roar.</p>

<p><i>At Breakfast.</i>&mdash;"Um," says <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, thinking over something
as he cuts a ham, "we shan't want to take anything with us, because
Old <span class="smcap">Penolver</span> gives us lunch. He's a picture of an Old English
Squire is <span class="smcap">Penolver</span>. Quite a picture of a&mdash;um&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;" here he
apparently considers to himself whether he has given a correct
definition of <span class="smcap">Penolver</span> or not. He seems satisfied, and closes his
account of him by repeating, "Yes&mdash;um&mdash;yes&mdash;an Old English
Squire, you know&mdash;quite a character in his way," (I thought so,)
"and you'll have pasties and cider."</p>

<p>"Pasties!" I exclaim. The word recalls Bluff <span class="smcap">King Hal's</span> time,
the jollifications&mdash;by my halidame!&mdash;gadso!&mdash;crushing a cup, and
so forth. Now I have the picture before me (in my mind's eye) of
the Old English Squire, attended by grooms bearing pasties and
flagons, meeting the Otter Hunters with spears and dogs. Good!
Excellent! I feel that My Health will be benefited by the air of the
olden time. And perhaps by the pasties.</p>

<p>"Do any ladies come?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Safe to," answers <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, "last day of hunting&mdash;all the
ladies out&mdash;sort of show meet, and lounge."</p>

<p>Pasties, flagons, dames, gallants with lutes, and pages with
beakers of wine. I am all anxiety to start.</p>

<p><i>The Drive.</i>&mdash;Bleak, misty, sharp, dreary. I am in summer costume
of flannels, intended for running. Hope we <i>shall</i> have some
running, as at present I'm blue with cold and shivering.</p>

<p><i>Six miles finished.</i>&mdash;We get out at a tumble-down roadside inn.
Three boys, each one lankier and colder-looking than the other, are
standing together with their hands in their pockets, there being
evidently among them a dearth of gloves. A rough man in a
velveteen coat and leggings appears, carrying a sort of quarter-staff
spiked. I connect him at once with otters. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> returns his
salute. This is the Huntsman. The three chilly boys are the Field.
We are all shivering, and evidently only half awake. Is this what
<span class="smcap">Pendell</span> calls a "show meet, and a lounge?"</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;To say brightly, "Well, it couldn't have been <i>colder</i> for
an <i>otter</i> hunt." The chilly boys hearing this, turn away, the man
with the spear takes it literally and is offended, "because," he says,
"we might ha' had a much worse day." <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> says to himself,
thoughtfully. "Um&mdash;<i>colder</i>&mdash;<i>otter</i>&mdash;ha! Yes, I see. I've made
that myself lots of times." I thought that down here, perhaps, it
wouldn't have been known. Never risk an old joke again. If I
feel it's the only one I've got, preface it by saying, "Of course
you've heard what the Attorney-General said the other day to
(some one)?" and then, if on being told, they say, "O! that's
very old," why it's not your fault.</p>

<p>A fly appears on the road with the Master. He welcomes <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
and friend heartily and courteously. Is sorry that it's the last
meet. Thinks it's a bad day, and in the most genial manner possible
damps all my hopes of seeing an otter. "A few weeks ago,"
he says, "there were plenty of otters."</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;To find out if that spearing-picture is correct. Show myself
deeply interested in otters.</p>

<p>The Master says that spearing is unsportsmanlike. Damper
number two. No spears. We walk on, and get a little warmer.</p>

<p>More "Field" meets us: some mounted.</p>

<p><i>Note on Otter-Hunting.</i>&mdash;Better than fox-hunting, because you
trust to <i>your own</i> legs. You can't be thrown, you can't be kicked
off, or reared off; and, except you find yourself alone with the
otter in a corner, there's no danger.</p>

<p><i>Note Number Two. Additional.</i>&mdash;Yes, there is one other danger.
A great one.</p>

<p>Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>We have been walking miles along the banks of a stream, crossing
difficult stepping-stones, climbing over banks eight feet high
[thank goodness, impossible for horses], with drops on the other
side, and occasional jumpings down, which shake your teeth,
but still you land on <i>your own</i> legs, and if you fall you haven't got
a brute on the top of you, or rolling over you, or kicking out your
brains with his hind hoofs. We number about sixty in the Field.
The shaggy, rough hounds are working up-stream, swimming and
trotting, and stopping to examine the surface of any boulder which
strikes their noses as having been lately the temporary resting-place
of an otter. A few people on horseback are proceeding, slowly
in single file, along the bank. Difficult work for them. Ladies, too,
are on foot, and all going along as pleasantly as possible. Suddenly
a cry&mdash;a large dog is seen shaking its head wildly, and rubbing his
front paws over his ears&mdash;another dog is rolling on the bank&mdash;another
plunges into the river furiously, also shaking his head
as if he was objecting to everything generally, and would rather
drown than change his opinions.</p>

<p>Another cry.</p>

<p>Horses plunging&mdash;one almost into the river&mdash;shrieks of ladies&mdash;exclamations
from pedestrians&mdash;the field is scattered&mdash;some attempt
to ford the river&mdash;some jump right in&mdash;some on horseback cross it
shouting&mdash;some plunge into the plantation on the left&mdash;some are
running back upon us! A panic.</p>

<p>Mad bull, perhaps&mdash;if so&mdash;with admirable presence of mind I
jump into the water up to my waist, and am making for the opposite
side, when a man, running and smoking a short pipe, answers
my question as to the bull with&mdash;</p>

<p>"No! Wasps! Wasps' nest!!" In a second I see them. <i>At</i>
me. Pursuing me. I dive my head under water. Wet through!
Scramble up bank. One wasp is after me. One pertinaciously.
My foot catches in a root, I am down. Wasp down too, close at my
ear. A minute more I am up. Wasp up too, by my right ear.</p>

<p><i>An Inspiration.</i>&mdash;It flashes across me that wasps hate mud.
Don't know where I heard it. Think it was in some child's educational
book. No time for thinking. Jump&mdash;squish&mdash;into the mud!
Over my knees&mdash;boots nearly off. The last thing I see of <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
is holding on his spectacles with his left hand, and fighting a wasp
with his stick in his right. Squish&mdash;flop&mdash;flosh!... Up against a
stump&mdash;down in a morass. Wasp at me. Close to my ear as if he
wanted to tell me a secret. I won't hear it! Now I understand why
the dog shook his head. Through a bramble bush (like the Man
in the Nursery Rhyme, who scratched both his eyes out and in
again by a similar operation), and come out torn and scratched,
but dry as a pen after being dragged through a patent wiper of
erect bristles. No wasp. Gone. I am free. But still I keep on.</p>

<p>That's the only great danger in Otter-Hunting. At least, that I
know of at present.</p>

<p>I pick up the man with pipe. Kindest creature in the world. He
has two pipes, and he fills and gives me one. He says, "Wasps
won't attack a smoker."</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;Smoke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pendell</span> comes up. "Um!&mdash;aha!" he says; "narrow escape!"
He has <i>not</i> been stung.</p>

<p>The Field is pulling itself together again. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> chuckles.
"Did you see Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>?" he asks. "There were two wasps
at him."</p>

<p>No! It appears that Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> has been quite close to me
throughout the day. Yet there was no laughing crowd, and I
haven't heard one of <span class="smcap">Ruddock's</span> jokes bruited about. Odd. Wonder
how the wasps liked <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>.</p>

<h2>HINTS ON CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.</h2>

<h3>(<i>By a good Old-fashioned Clown.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Knock</span> at a shop-door, and then lie down flat in front of it, so
that the shopman, coming out, may tumble headlong over you.
Then bolt into the shop, and cram into your pockets all the big
things you can find, so that in trying to get out, you cannot squeeze
them through the doorway. For instance, if it be a watchmaker's,
clap an eight-day kitchen clock and a barometer or two, let us say,
in your right pocket, and a brass warming-pan, or some such little
article of jewellery (as you will take care to call it) in your left one;
taking pains, of course, to let the handle stick well out of it. If it
be a butcher's, pouch a leg of beef and half a sheep or so, and be
sure not to forget to bring a yard or two of sausages trailing on the
ground behind you. Then, if you can't squeeze through the doorway,
the simplest plan will be to jump clean through the shop-front,
and in doing this take care to smash as many panes of glass as you
are able, crying out, of course, that you took "great pains" to do
so. <i>En passant</i>, you will kick into the street whatever goods are
in the window, and then run off as quickly as your heels can carry
you.</p>

<p>If the shopman should pursue you, as most probably he will, make
him a low bow, and say that it was really quite an accident, and
that of course you mean to pay him&mdash;indeed, yes, "on your <i>honour</i>!"
If he won't believe you, punch him in the waistcoat, and batter
him about with his barometer and warming-pan, or sausages and
mutton.</p>

<p>Should a policeman interfere, and want to know what you are up
to, catch up your red-hot poker (which you will always have about
you), and hold it hidden behind your back, while you beg him to
shake hands with you, because you mean to "square the job" with
him. Then, when he puts his hand out, slap the poker into it, and
run away as fast as your stolen goods will let you.</p>

<p>But after a few steps, of course you must take care to let the
handle of your warming-pan get stuck between your legs, and trip
you up occasionally; and you will manage that your sausages become
entangled so about you that, at every second step, you are obliged
to tumble down and roll along the ground, and double up into a
heap, till the policeman, who keeps up the chace, comes close enough
to catch you. Then you will spring up again, and, jumping on his
back, you will be carried off to Bow Street, with the small boys
shouting after you; or, else, if you prefer it, you may "bonnet"
the policeman, and run away and hide yourself ere he can lift his
hat up, to see where you are gone to.</p>

<h2>SCIENCE FOR THE SEASON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Charles Lyell</span>, according to a correspondent of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, is credited with the saying that there are three things
necessary for a geologist: the first is to travel; the second is to
travel; and the third, also, is to travel. This seems to mean that
your geologist must travel, travel, travel over the face of the earth
in order to be enabled to explore its interior. The earth is round;
so is your plum-pudding: the earth has a crust; so has your mince-pie.
Happily, conditions like those needful for the exploration of
the earth do not delay analogous researches.</p>

<h2>TWELFTH NIGHT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> closing night of the Christmas season is observed by every
nation in Europe, except Switzerland, in which country the Republican
form of government introduced by <span class="smcap">W. Tell</span> (the first President),
prevents the recognition of Kings and Queens.</p>

<p>Throughout England, particularly in those rural districts where
the study of physics is yet in its infancy, great importance is
attached to the weather on Twelfth Day. The occurrence of rain,
or wind, or sleet, or snow, or hail, or the appearance of the Aurora
Borealis over the roofs of the Bank of England is considered a most
favourable augury, and in some counties determines the day on
which the sowing of the Spring wheat commences. But the slightest
indication of the Zodiacal light is dreaded as a sure forerunner of the
turnip-fly, and the connection of a parhelion with protracted drought
is established by a long series of observations, reaching as far back
as the Reformation.</p>

<p>Most lawyers are of opinion that under the provisions of an old
Act of Parliament, still unrepealed, it is illegal to solicit a Christmas
box after twelve o'clock on the 6th of January.</p>

<p>If Twelfth Night falls on a Sunday, the harvest will be late; if
on a Monday, the back door should be carefully looked to on the long
evenings; if on a Tuesday, pilchards will be caught in enormous
quantities; if on a Wednesday, the silkworms will suffer; if on a
Thursday, there will be no skating on the Serpentine during the rest
of the year; if on a Friday, the apple crop will be a failure; and if
on a Saturday (as this year), you should on no account have your
hair cut by a red-haired man who squints and has relations in
the colonies. The sceptic and the latitudinarian may smile superciliously
at these predictions, but they have been verified by inquiries
conducted at centres as wide apart as Bury St. Edmunds, Rotherham,
Dawlish, Rickmansworth, Kirkcudbright, and Cape Clear.</p>

<h2>NEW YEAR'S "<i>NOTE</i>" TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, in spite of his emphatic and repeated Notices and
Explanations, being still copiously afflicted with Communications
from Persons whom he has not invited to take the liberty of addressing
him, issues the following <span class="cursive">Note</span>, and advises such persons to study
it closely.</p>

<p>He calls them "Correspondents," but does so only for convenience.
A Correspondent means a person who not only writes, but to whom
the recipient of the letter also writes. Ninety-nine out of a hundred
of those who address <i>Mr. Punch</i> are, and will be, unanswered,
except by this Note.</p>

<p>Let all understand that he is answerable for the real or supposed
value of No literary or artistic matter which may be sent him,
unasked. This is law. Let all understand that at the earliest
possible moment after his discovery that such matter is useless to
him, it is Destroyed. This is fact.</p>

<p>Notice also that stamped and directed envelopes, for the return
of such matters, will not operate to the fracture of his rule.</p>

<p>After this notice, "Correspondents" will have no one but themselves
to thank for the Snub <i>Mr. Punch's</i> silence implies.</p>

<p>But is he unwise enough to believe that the plague of foolish
Correspondence will thus be stayed? Verily, no.</p>

<p>He expects to continue to receive&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Jests that have appeared in his own pages, but which
are warranted to have been invented, or heard, "the other
day."</p>

<p>2. The jest of the day, one that has been heard a million
times.</p>

<p>3. Profane, and even lower jests, sent by creatures who
pretend to be readers of <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>4. Idiotic jests, usually laid upon the shoulders of "my
little boy," or "my youngest girl." <i>Punch</i> would pity the
children of such parents, but that he generally disbelieves
in the existence of the innocents.</p>

<p>5. Sketches, to be used in his next without fail, or, if
rejected, to be instantly returned. These burn well, and he
prefers those on cardboard, as they crackle prettily.</p>

<p>6. Things, literary or artistic, that have been "dashed
off." The mere word "dash" is the cue for instant fire.</p>

<p>7. Compositions, poor in themselves, whose insertion is
prayed because the authors are poor also. Is <i>Mr. Punch</i> to
perform his charities at the expense of society?</p>

<p>8. Aged jokes, possibly recently heard for the first time
by the Stupid Sender, but more probably copied from print.</p>

<p>9. Post-Cards, or communications with the Halfpenny
Stamp. These are all selected by his Deputy-Assistant-Under-Secretary,
and destroyed unread.</p>

<p>10. Absolute Stupidities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let them come. And when a Sender getteth no answer, let him
take counsel with himself, and consider to which of the above Ten
Categories his work belongs. One will certainly fit it. To this
Table <i>Mr. Punch</i> will make reference when he may please to do
so. Let intending Contributors learn it by heart.</p>

<p>Now, laying down the Chopper of <span class="smcap">Lycurgus</span>, and putting on the
Smile of <span class="smcap">Plato</span>, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, raising the festal goblet, wisheth to all
his faithful and true Disciples, those whose handwritings ever give
him joy and gladness,&mdash;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
